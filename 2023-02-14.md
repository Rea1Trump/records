The libwmf port currently does not have a maintainer. As a result, it is
more likely to have unresolved issues, not be up-to-date, or even be removed in
the future. To volunteer to maintain this port, please create an issue at:

Install the math/gmp port to enable accelerated processing with the GNU
Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library. PyCryptodome will use the
optional enhancement at runtime automatically if the library is

To talk to USB and MTP devices the user needs to be able to access
the device node in /dev.

to be aware of USB devices attached to the machine, the user needs
to be a member of the operator group:

# pw groupmod operator -m yourusername

Then, add the following to /etc/devfs.rules, or create this file
if it does not exist yet:

[system=10]
add path 'usb/*' mode 0660 group operator

To load these new rules, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

devfs_system_ruleset="system"

Then, restart devfs

# service devfs restart

If you are using an Android device as your e-book reader, please note
that the stock Google Books app uses a storage format that is not
supported by calibre.  The calibre FAQ recommends that either of the
free apps Aldiko or WordPlayer are used instead.

A basic startup script for calibre-server has been installed.

Please make sure you have a Bonjour/zeroconf DNS-SD server running.

For instance add the following configuration in
/usr/local/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf

[reflector]
reflect-filters=_airplay._tcp.local,_raop._tcp.local

```

4. `uxplay` usage:

- install `uxlplay`.
- follow the install notice of the uxplay
- starts the avahi-daemon(in root).(manual page for detial)
- iPad -> mirror you screen.

> https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=avahi-daemon&sektion=8&apropos=0&manpath=FreeBSD+13.1-RELEASE+and+Ports


In FreeBSD, you have to explicitly allow services outside the core system to start. In your /etc/rc.conf add the following line:

```bash 

avahi_daemon_enable="YES"

(You might also need avahi_dnsconfd_enable="YES".)

```
