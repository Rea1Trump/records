1. Gitup to get the source code. 
- install the `gitup`
- modify the config file `/usr/local/etc/gitup.conf` to enable the proxy (root)
- `gitup release` (root)
2. Today, I try to compile my own kernel `MY_GENERIC_20230215` (The KERNCONF name)

3. Steps to make your own kernel:

```bash
# copy the GENERIC to a dir, and rename it to MY_xxxx_xxxx

# make a softlink to it 

# modify the manual KERNCONF file.

# compile and install it.
cd /usr/src

make buildkernel KERNCONF=MY_xxxx_xxxx

make installkernel KERNCONF=MY_xxxx_xxxx

# reboot and test it.





```
