2. Install rslsync

```bash

net-p2p/rslsync includes an RC script:
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/rslsync

TO START ON BOOT:
# sysrc rslsync_enable=YES

START MANUALLY:
# service rslsync start

Once started, visit the following to configure:
http://localhost:8888/

===> SECURITY REPORT: 
      This port has installed the following files which may act as network
      servers and may therefore pose a remote security risk to the system.
/usr/local/bin/rslsync

      If there are vulnerabilities in these programs there may be a security
      risk to the system. FreeBSD makes no guarantee about the security of
      ports included in the Ports Collection. Please type 'make deinstall'
      to deinstall the port if this is a concern.

      For more information, and contact details about the security
      status of this software, see the following webpage:

===>  Cleaning for rslsync-2.7.3

```

3. Check the `/etc/rc.d` or `/usr/local/etc/rc.d` for `rc_scripts`


4. The rslsync install from ports will create a user `rslsync`, check the `/etc/group` for detail

```bash
# Enable the user rslsync to add/remove file in your /home/user/path_of_rsl 
# add the user rslsync to your_user_group in /etc/group

doas nvim /etc/group

# modify
# save and quit

# create the path_of_rsl
# my path_of_rsl is /home/sigma/Documents/rslsync/
mkdir -p /home/sigma/Documents/rslsync/

# I mkdir the sub_dir xx and xxx in path_of_rsl, 
cd /home/sigma/Documents/rslsync/
mkdir xx
mkdir xxx

# thus need the -R flag.  
chmod -R g+w /home/sigma/Documents/rslsync


```
5. `/etc/make.conf`
```bash
# get the example file of make.conf (man page for detail)
cp /usr/share/examples/etc/make.conf /etc/make.conf



doas nvim /etc/make.conf
# add lines 

FETCH_CMD=aria2c		# need to install aria2
DISABLE_SIZE=yes		

FORCE_MAKE_JOBS=yes		# multi_jobs?
MAKE_JOBS_NUMBER=6


```
