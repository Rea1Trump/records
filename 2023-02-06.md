1. Try to get the qtile, but the pywlroots Repos failing
2. Try to set the CPATH to indicate the ENV of the cc(clang or gcc?)
3. creat soft links of wlr and change the the default wlr to wlr16 and link.
```bash
pkg info wlroots 


pkg info wlroots15 


# see the differences of the locate

```
to handle the different version of the software.

Actually, using different version of software to manully install 3rd apps is not recommand.(fuck off)

4. Accustomed to neovim.

5. search apps in FreshPorts to see the dependencies and the to\_be\_modified dirs.

6. dwl is not for me.

7. other mod keys in wm config


```bash
xmodmap

# see the mod key map, and the mod 5 is \ (backslash 0x005c or 0x5c)
# The output is as follow:
xmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3      
mod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)
mod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)

# I got the key code of the key mod 5 (0x5c)
# Then I use the xev to to set the key map and find the right key 

xev

# And press the key to test.
# Also you can check the xkbcommon-keysyms.h to find the key code (0x5c)

# The dir is /usr/local/include/xkbcommon
# PS: need to install the libxkbcommon
# And the files are as follow
# Open the xkbcommon-keysyms.h search the "5c" you got 0x005c
# The key is backslash
