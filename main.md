# This is a note for freebsd cofig

libxkbcommon-keysyms.h

using the xev to see the key map and the keycode
(xev cause crash in wmhb but behavor well in wmhk wmwf)

key mute, volumeup, volumndown, print,fn works.

I want to:
1. get my kernel config for my desktop Thinkpad T480

2. and get all the key map the function it should be.

3. test all the wayland compositer. 

4. make the app_launcher taskbar panel logout_panel work on the wayland compositer

5. work out  nice look styles and  nice work config files.

HAVE:
	wayfire:
		{
			Super key not responce
		}
	hikari:
		{
			Super key not responce
		
		}

	sway:
		{
			strange error when using the swaylock-effect
		}


	Hyprland:
		{
			unstable, always crash

		}
6. Software for wayland to test:
		waybar
		
		swaybg

		hyprpaper  for hyprland to change the bg-img		

		I have get the rofi-wayland for rofi, for the wofi is too young to simple.
