or by adding

       cuse_load="YES"

to your /boot/loader.conf

2) add webcamd_enable="YES"

Your SDL library has been built with libvgl support, which means that you
 can run almost any SDL application straight on your console (VESA 2.0
 compatible videocard is required).

 To do this you have to load the vesa kernel module or enable it in your
 kernel, and set environment variable "SDL_VIDEODRIVER=vgl".

```

either in dwl/Makefile.local, make.conf(5), environ(7) or command line e.g.,
$ make install clean DWL_CONF=/path/to/dwl/config.h

5. polybar

```bash
Message from polybar-3.6.3:

--
Polybar was originally built with Linux in mind, so certain modules do
not function in FreeBSD.

Working modules:
- bspwm
- date
- github
- i3
- ipc (polybar-msg method does not seem to work)
- menu
- mpd
- script
- text
- xkeyboard
- xwindow
- xworkspaces (not extensively tested)

Broken modules:
- cpu
- filesystem
- memory
- network (requires wireless_tools)
- temperature (requires /sys/class/thermal/* in sysfs)
- volume (requires full alsa, not a wrapper)

Unknown:
- backlight
- battery
- xbacklight

```

Message from jackit-1.9.22:

--
The new JACK server comes with a DBUS control interface:

$ jack_control help
$ jack_control ds oss
$ jack_control dp
$ jack_control eps realtime False
$ jack_control start

Only root can grant real-time priority to processes for now, using rtprio(1).
Upcoming FreeBSD releases will have a MAC policy with a realtime user group.

Memory locking has to be allowed in /etc/login.conf or ~/.login_conf. Set the
resource limit ":memorylocked=unlimited:" and don't forget to run

# cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf

It's still possible to start JACK server as an RC service for a dedicated user.
Note that only one JACK server can be run at a time. An /etc/rc.conf example:

jackd_enable="YES"
jackd_user="joe"
jackd_rtprio="YES"
jackd_args="-R -doss -r48000 -p1024 -n1 -w16 \
            --capture /dev/dsp0 --playback /dev/dsp0"

Official JACK example clients and tools are available as jack-example-tools.

JACK 1.9.22 introduces a latency correction fix.
Latency correction parameters have to be measured again after an update.
